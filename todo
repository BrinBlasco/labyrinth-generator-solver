actually implement these fuckers
but before that get other stuffs working like
actually displaying a path, backtrack back to
the starting point etc etc
--

--
try doing with graph maybe (myb will fix shit idfk)  // maybe, but for now a separate maze class did the trick
--

--
path with lines and width instead of drawing sqaures
cuz fuck squares
(future - did both at the same time, junctions are done by squares, lines for the paths between them)

TODO:

BFS,      [x]
DFS,      [x]
Dijkstra
A-Star

click to set starting point //some shit with promises, will do a separate grid and draw the point there and make it draggable or smth
separate grid for drawing paths, and at the start the starting point of grid gen from a random point, solution gen from 2 points, both draggable...

this should be it for the time being. (will regret writing this later)
